# Library-Management-System
Simple library management system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
The project comprised two main classes: Book and Library. The Book class managed attributes such as title, author, and copies. It featured methods for displaying book information, borrowing a book (which decreased the number of available copies), and returning a book (which increased the number of copies). The Library class was designed to manage a collection of Book instances. It included methods for adding books to the library's inventory, displaying all books, and finding a specific book by its title. The implementation of these classes demonstrated practical use of OOP concepts like encapsulation and object interaction, providing a foundational understanding of how to structure and manage a simple library system programmatically.
